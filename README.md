# PDFfairy


PDFfairy is a python package or tool kit to work with PDF files. This package will have some codes grabbed from [PDFMiner.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six). I think PDFMiner organized code in a different way, I don't want to organize code in that way. So some parts may look rewrite of PDFMiner. Also in order to get more insights about PDF standards I'm looking into lots of other packages like [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF), [PDFCPU](https://github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu/tree/master) etc. So there can be lot of inspirations from these libraries and packages.
